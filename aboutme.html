					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<h3>BLUF</h3>
                    <p>
                    I’m an Information Science student at the University of Maryland with an Associate of Arts in Computer Science, seeking an internship or entry-level role in
                    intelligence analysis, cybersecurity, or technical operations. I’m strongest in structured thinking, working through
                    uncertainty, being curious, and clearly explaining what the available information does—and does not—support.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Key Judgments</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Analytic approach:</strong> I prioritize clarity, evidence, and decision-useful conclusions over speculation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operational background:</strong> Years in demanding environments shaped how I perform under time pressure and ambiguity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical foundation:</strong> My core interests are Python, SQL, Linux, and OSINT—used to support research and analysis.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                    I’m an Information Science student with experience in federal research and a long track record working in high-demand
                    operational settings. Before returning to academia, I spent much of my early professional career in culinary operations, working in
                    high-performance environments ranging from Michelin-recognized restaurants to leadership roles within
                    large multinational organizations. That experience involved managing complex, time-sensitive operations,
                    enforcing standards under pressure, and coordinating teams in settings where small errors had outsized
                    consequences.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Current Focus</h3>
                    <p>
                    I’m actively building skills in Python, SQL, Linux, and OSINT techniques through coursework, and in my spare time. I try to emphasis on repeatable workflows,
                    clear write-ups, and defensible conclusions. I’m currently working through
                    <em>OSINT Techniques: Resources for Uncovering Online Information</em> (Michael Bazzell & Jason Edison). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As part of my applied learning, I’m using QGIS to track and visualize Chinese military exercises around Taiwan,
                    with the goal of identifying patterns and indicators that could inform assessments of potential threat vectors.
                    In parallel, I’m exploring the use of AI-assisted tools to support intelligence workflows—specifically to
                    reduce manual overhead and improve the speed and clarity with which information is delivered to
                    decision-makers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What I’m Seeking</h3>
                    <p>
                    Internship or entry-level opportunities in intelligence analysis, cybersecurity, or technical operations—especially work
                    that supports mission-relevant decision-making and requires careful reasoning, documentation, and disciplined analysis.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Personal Notes (Low Confidence / Context Only)</h3>
                    <p>
                    Outside of coursework, I spend a lot of time reading intelligence and security topics, and experimenting with
                    OSINT tools and techniques. I’ve been an avid outdoorsman since my youth, and when I’m not reading or in front of a screen, that’s usually where you’ll find me.
                    </p>
